# Dynamic xAxis Bar with Zoom In and Zoom Out

I have created an xAxis bar. 

You can define everything in the constants section, including how many ticks in the chart, what is the range between every tick in pixels, zoom in and zoom out limits and what is the jump value between every tick.

After you define these constants everything is generated using native JavaScript. 

All the code commented and should be easy to read.
 
Enjoy!
